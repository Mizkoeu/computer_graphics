Homework #1 2DGame
Project Statement

Mike Zou

List of Completed Features:
1.	Stellar: Completed;
2.	Lovely: Heart shape is completed with help from WolframAlpha;
3.	Heartbeat: Completed by passing time uniform onto Heart object;
4.	Gyro: The squares in this game are constantly rotating;
5.	Swap: Completed with legal and sticky drag;
6.	Legal: Implemented with the help of three-in-a-line feature. You may test and see that if the swap does not result in any three-in-line pop, the object returns to its original position after mouse release;
7.	Sticky: Implemented. The objects can be dragged and follow the mouse coordinates constantly until mouse is released;
8.	Bomb: Completed, number of times used is not limited;
9.	Quake: Completed, number of times used is not limited;
10.	Three-in-a-line: Completed;
11.	Dramatic Exit: Completed as the objects disappear, they rotate and shrink in size very quickly. Fast, but visible;
12.	Skyfall: Completed;
13.	Feather fall: Completed. As the objects in the 2DArray are drawn in certain sequence, when they do the falling animation, sometimes one might hide another, creating somewhat chaotic scene. This could be considered a bug to be fixed later on;
14.	Turn the Table: Completed, with restriction that the rotation cannot be over 90 degrees on both sides;
15.	Downshift: Completed.
